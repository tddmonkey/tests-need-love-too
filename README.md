# Tests Need Love Too

This is the book I wrote for Developer Press way back in 2014? 2015 maybe? Sometime after publishing Developer Press closed down leaving me with the copyright to do as I please, so I present it here.

You can view the book in the [original PDF version](./tests-need-love-too-ebook.pdf) (preferred), or [Markdown format](./tests-need-love-too.md).

If you've enjoyed what you've read here, feel free to reach out at @tddmonkey.bsky.social.
